# Design Patterns: CoffeeMachine
The final assignment for Design Patterns module made by Lars Versteeg.

The essence of this assignment was to refactor a project made by a beginner programmer and use various amounts of refactor methods to make sure the application has better preformance and overal clean/reusable code.

The project was not finished when it was handed to me, so we had to add more elements/functions to the project such as a JSON parser, image converters, discount/price calculators and factories for the new code.

This was my first time working with any kind of JSON files, which was very intriguing but also very challenging. This is probably one of the modules in our curriculum that I learned the most from, because after I passed it I knew I was a better software engineer.

In this application you can find examples of Design Patterns like:
- Factories
- Adapter pattern
- Observer Observable
- Refactoring Techniques
